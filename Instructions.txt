git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.name "user@uwo.ca"

You should be at C:\Users\User\
If you have already dealt with ssh keys, you have a .ssh directory.
cd .ssh

You can back up your ssh keys with
mkdir key_backup
copy id_ed25519* key_backup

If you don't have a directory,
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "user@uwo.ca"

Overwrite, yes.
I just used empty.

Once you are done, type:
clip < id_ed25519.pub

Move to bit bucket, top right, profile, manage account
go to SSH keys
paste what you copied in there and thats it.
Do the optional things if you wish to do them.
Add the key.

Once you are done, you can go back to the repository
On the left side, there is an icon called clone.
Click it, and copy the link it shows.
Go back to your terminal/CMD and type
git clone pasteyourURLhere
You can paste by click the window frame --> Edit --> paste.
yes to continue connecting

Congrats, if it worked you now have a folder under your User that is the repo.
Go to your IDE and open that folder up.
You are green and good to go.
